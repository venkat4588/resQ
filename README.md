<h1 align="center">resQ: A Road Accident Detection System using YOLOv11 and CCTV Surveillance</h1>

**resQ** is an AI-powered accident detection system designed to revolutionize road safety. By leveraging advanced computer vision technology, it detects vehicle collisions through CCTV footage and instantly notifies highway authorities, enabling swift emergency responses, and also provides the sevarity of the accident by displaying the range of the damage (low, high, midum) according to the deformation of the vechiles that appeares at accident incident.

## 🚀 Getting Started Guide

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine.

### 📦 Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following tools installed:

- ✅ **Node.js** (v14 or later)  
- ✅ **npm** or **yarn**  
- ✅ **Python** (v3.8 or later)  
- ⚡ **CUDA Toolkit** (for GPU acceleration, optional)

> 💡 *Tip: Keep your packages up-to-date for best results.*

### 🔧 Installing CUDA

For GPU acceleration, install CUDA on your system.  [Watch Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nATRPPZ5dGE) for step-by-step guidance.  
Ensure your CUDA version matches your PyTorch build.

## 🛠️ Installation Steps

### 1. 📁 Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohan-krishna-kotha/resQ.git
cd resQ
```

### 2. ⚙️ Set Up the Frontend

Navigate to the frontend folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

### 3. 🔐 Configure Environment Variables (Frontend Only)

1. **Generate Authentication Secret**  
   Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory before running the following command:
   ```bash
   npx auth secret
   ```

2. **Set Up Google OAuth**
   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project and configure OAuth consent.
   - Set the Authorized Redirect URI to:
     ```
     http://localhost:3001/api/auth/callback/google
     ```

3. **Create or Update the Following Files in the `frontend` Directory:**

   `.env.local`
   ```
   AUTH_SECRET= # Automatically added by `npx auth`
   AUTH_GOOGLE_ID= # Your Google Client ID
   AUTH_GOOGLE_SECRET= # Your Google Client Secret
   ```

   `.env`
   ```
   DATABASE_URL= # Your Postgres database connection string
   ```

4. **Database Setup**  
   Make sure you are in the `frontend` directory before running the following commands:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   pnpm exec prisma migrate dev
   pnpm exec prisma generate
   ```

### 4. 🔌 Set Up the Backend

1. **Create a Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   python -m venv venv

   # For Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate

   # For macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

2. **Install PyTorch in Virtual Environment**  
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url 
   ```
   https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126

3. **Install Backend Dependencies**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ Running the Application

### 1. 🔙 Start the Backend (FastAPI)

```bash
cd backend
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```

The backend will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

### 2. 🌐 Start the Frontend (Next.js)

```bash
cd ../frontend
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

## How It Works 🚦

resQ is an AI-powered accident detection system that leverages advanced computer vision technology to identify vehicle collisions in CCTV Surveillance and facilitate rapid emergency response. Here's how it works:

### **Step-by-Step Process**

1. **Accident Happens**  
   A crash occurs on the highway, captured by CCTV cameras installed at strategic locations.

2. **CCTV Captures Footage**  
   The video feed is processed using a YOLO-based vehicle collision detection model to identify accidents with high accuracy.

3. **Seviyarity analysis**
   By deformation score of the vchiles which appeared at accident incident; the term sevarity is analysed like (midum,high, low).
   
4. **Instant Alert Sent**  
   Upon detecting an accident, the backend system sends an immediate alert to highway authorities via WebSocket integration.

5. **Verification and Response**  
   Authorities verify the incident through an intuitive dashboard and dispatch emergency services to the scene.
